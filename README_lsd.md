## Description

This project is heavily inspired by the super [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)
project but with some little differences.  For example it is written in rust and not in ruby which makes it much faster.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Install the patched fonts of powerline nerd-font and/or font-awesome. Have a look at the [Nerd Font README](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/readme.md) for more installation instructions. Don't forget to setup your terminal in order to use the correct font.

See [this issue comment](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd/issues/199#issuecomment-494218334) for detailed instructions on how to configure iTerm2 font settings correctly.

### On Archlinux

```sh
pacman -S lsd
```

### On Fedora

```sh
dnf install lsd
```

### On Ubuntu

_... and other Debian-based Linux distributions_

Download the latest .deb package from the [release page](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd/releases) and install it via:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i lsd_0.18.0_amd64.deb # adapt version number and architecture
```

### On Gentoo

```sh
sudo emerge sys-apps/lsd
```
(Ebuild maintained by Georgy Yakovlev)


### On macOS

via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install lsd
```

### On NixOS/From nix

```sh
nix-env -iA nixos.lsd
```

Or add `lsd` to your `configuration.nix` like so:

```nix
# ...
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # other packages ...
  lsd
];
# ...
```

### On FreeBSD

scoop install lsd
```
### On Android (via Termux)
```sh
pkg install lsd
```
[Setup Nerd Fonts in Termux](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd/issues/423)
### From Sources

With Rust's package manager cargo, you can install lsd via:

```sh
cargo install lsd
```

If you want to install the latest master branch commit:
```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd.git --branch master
```

### From Binaries

The [release page](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd/releases) includes precompiled binaries for Linux and macOS.

## Configuration

`lsd` can be configured with a configuration file to set the default options.
Right now this only supports setting options that can be passed via the command
line options as well.

### Config file location

#### Non-Windows

On non-Windows systems `lsd` follows the
[XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
convention for the location of the configuration file. The configuration dir
`lsd` uses is itself named `lsd`. In that directory it looks first for a file
called `config.yaml` and if it can't find one, a file named `config.yml`.
For most people it should be enough to put their config file at
`~/.config/lsd/config.yaml`.

#### Windows

On Windows systems `lsd` only looks for the two files in one location:
`%APPDATA%\lsd\`

### Config file content

This is an example config file with the default values and some additional
remarks.
```yaml
# == Classic ==
# This is a shorthand to override some of the options to be backwards compatible
# with `ls`. It affects the "color"->"when", "sorting"->"dir-grouping", "date"
# and "icons"->"when" options.
# Possible values: false, true
classic: false

# == Blocks ==
# This specifies the columns and their order when using the long and the tree
# layout.
# Possible values: permission, user, group, size, size_value, date, name, inode
blocks:
  - permission
  - user
  - group
  - size
  - date
  - name

# == Color ==
# This has various color options. (Will be expanded in the future.)
color:
  # When to colorize the output.
  # When "classic" is set, this is set to "never".
  # Possible values: never, auto, always
  when: auto

# == Date ==
# This specifies the date format for the date column. The freeform format
# accepts an strftime like string.
# When "classic" is set, this is set to "date".
# Possible values: date, relative, +<date_format>
date: date

# == Dereference ==
# Whether to dereference symbolic links.
# Possible values: false, true
dereference: false

# == Display ==
# What items to display. Do not specify this for the default behavior.
# Possible values: all, almost-all, directory-only
# display: all

# == Icons ==
icons:
  # When to use icons.
  # When "classic" is set, this is set to "never".
  # Possible values: always, auto, never
  when: auto
  # Which icon theme to use.
  # Possible values: fancy, unicode
  theme: fancy

# == Ignore Globs ==
# A list of globs to ignore when listing.
# ignore-globs:
#   - .git

# == Indicators ==
# Whether to add indicator characters to certain listed files.
# Possible values: false, true
indicators: false

# == Layout ==
# Which layout to use. "oneline" might be a bit confusing here and should be
# called "one-per-line". It might be changed in the future.
# Possible values: grid, tree, oneline
layout: grid

# == Recursion ==
recursion:
  # Whether to enable recursion.
  # Possible values: false, true
  enabled: false
  # How deep the recursion should go. This has to be a positive integer. Leave
  # it unspecified for (virtually) infinite.
  # depth: 3

# == Size ==
# Specifies the format of the size column.
# Possible values: default, short, bytes
size: default

# == Sorting ==
sorting:
  # Specify what to sort by.
  # Possible values: extension, name, time, size, version
  column: name
  # Whether to reverse the sorting.
  # Possible values: false, true
  reverse: false
  # Whether to group directories together and where.
  # When "classic" is set, this is set to "none".
  # Possible values: first, last, none
  dir-grouping: none

# == No Symlink ==
# Whether to omit showing symlink targets
# Possible values: false, true
no-symlink: false

# == Total size ==
# Whether to display the total size of directories.
# Possible values: false, true
total-size: false
```

## External Configurations

### Required

Enable nerd fonts for your terminal, URxvt for example:

.Xresources
```
URxvt*font:    xft:Hack Nerd Font:style=Regular:size=11
```

### Optional


In order to use lsd when entering the `ls` command, you need to add this to your shell
configuration file  (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):

  ```sh
  alias ls='lsd'
  ```

Some further examples of useful aliases:

  ```sh
  alias l='ls -l'
  alias la='ls -a'
  alias lla='ls -la'
  alias lt='ls --tree'
  ```

## F.A.Q.

### Default Colors

In the future the possibility to customize the colors might be implemented.
For now, the default colors are:

### UTF-8 Chars

`lsd` will try to display the UTF-8 chars in file name, A `U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`(ï¿½) is used to represent the invalid UTF-8 chars.
